# Agile Principles

Agile Principles form the third largest section of the [Agile Onion](https://www.adventureswithagile.com/2016/08/10/what-is-agile/), as shown in the Agile Introduction.

Principles fall under "can be adopted in command and control" and "requires structural and cultural change". They are in the middle of impact scale, Less visible however more powerful.


## History of the Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto was created on February 2001 by seventeen individuals frustrated with the way software development was working.

In short they all went up to the top of a mountain retreat and didn't come back down again until all seventeen signed a symbolic "Manifesto for Agile software development".

The only concern with the word "Agile" came from Alistair Cockburn (a Brit), who's concern was that most American's wouldn't know how to pronounce the word Agile.

If you'd like to understand more detail on the history of the Manifesto, you can read it [here](http://agilemanifesto.org/history.html)


## The Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

**Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.


## Principles behind the Agile Manifesto

*We follow these 12 principles:*

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.

- Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.

- Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.

- Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.

- Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.

- The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.

- Working software is the primary measure of progress.

- Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

- Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.

- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.

- The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.

- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.
