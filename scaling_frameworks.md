# Scaling Frameworks

## What are scaling frameworks?

As agile continues to grow in popularity, so does the idea of scaling out agile across a whole organisation.

As such there are now quite a few scaling frameworks in the market.

What do I mean by scaling across a whole organisation? well to put it simply, agile practices are commonly adopted in project teams/software development teams and not supporting functions such as HR, Finance and the Contact Centre to give a few examples.

Scaling fameworks attempt to close that gap by having a whole organisation work in a consistent approach. A weakness of this, is that individual circumstances are not acknolwedged and it can feel as if its process and tools rather than individuals and iteractions.

## What scaling frameworks exist?

There are quite a few, each has a different interpretation to process and principles and method for adopting the framework.

I'm going to focus on the 3 most popular scaling frameworks, SAFe, LeSS and DAD.

- SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework for Enterprises)
- LeSS (Large Scale Scrum)
- DAD (Disciplined Agile Delivery)

## SAFe

[SAFe](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/) is probably the most commonly deployed and acknolwedged scaling framework.

### What is SAFe?

In their own words, SAFe is;

The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe®) helps businesses address the significant challenges of developing and delivering enterprise-class software and systems in the shortest sustainable lead time. It is as an online, freely revealed knowledge base of proven success patterns for implementing Lean-Agile software and systems at enterprise scale. 

SAFe synchronizes alignment, collaboration, and delivery for large numbers of Agile teams. Scalable and configurable, SAFe allows each organization to adapt it to its own business needs. It supports smaller-scale solutions employing 50–125 practitioners, as well as complex systems that require thousands of people. 

An extensive body of knowledge, SAFe describes the roles, responsibilities, artifacts, and activities necessary to implement Lean-Agile development. To illustrate SAFe concepts, this website features an interactive Big Picture graphic, which is a visual overview of the framework and is the primary user interface to the knowledge base. Each icon of the image is clickable, offering access to an article on that topic, as well as links to related information.
