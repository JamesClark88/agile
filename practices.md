# Practices

Agile practices sit at the second layer of the [Agile Onion](https://www.adventureswithagile.com/2016/08/10/what-is-agile/), as shown in the Agile Introduction.

Practices fall under "can be adopted in command and control" they are the more visible, however less powerful.

There are many practices under the agile umbrella, from frameworks like Scrum and Kanban, practices like story mapping, story writing and estimation to methodologies like Lean.

If you are interested to know more about a practice not listed below, please reach out to one of you agile coaches and we'll add it for you.

## Agile Frameworks

A selection of most commonly used Agile frameworks are listed below, there are over 20 different frameworks current in use in Agile software development.

- [Scrum](https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum)
- [Kanban](http://leankanban.com/)
- [Scrumban](https://www.agilealliance.org/what-is-scrumban/)
- [Extreme Programming XP](http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/what-is-extreme-programming/)

For a more detailed explanation of the above frameworks see the [frameworks](./frameworks.markdown) page.

## Scaling Frameworks

If you are interested in looking into scaling frameworks (practices for scaling large software development teams, usually over 1000 developers), take a look at a couple of links below;

- [SAFe](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/) Scaled Agile Framework for Enterprises
- [LeSS](https://less.works/less/framework/index.html) Large Scale Scrum for Enterprises
- [DAD](http://www.disciplinedagiledelivery.com/) Disciplined Agile Delivery
- [ESP](http://leankanban.com/esp/) Enterprise Services Planning

There are plenty of [articles and reviews](http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/safe-good-but-not-good-enough/) on all these scaling frameworks on the internet, I don't wish to influence anyone on the above, however this is a rather interesting [article](http://www.cio.com/article/3023903/agile-development/can-agile-scale-and-does-it-matter.html)

## BML (Build Measure Learn) and MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

Build Measure Learn and Minimum Viable Product are both practices from Eric Ries book [Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) you can find a copy of this in the kitchen or visit [Blinkist](https://www.blinkist.com) to listen to a 15 minute audio version. You can find login details

The Lean Startup follows the Lean Methodologies principles and practices.

### BML (Build Measure Learn)

You can find a diagram explaining the flow of BML [here](./resources/BML.png). The concept of BML is to ultimately validate whether we should or shouldn't spend time investing money in developing a new product/idea. This can lead to a complete about turn on the product, called a "pivot", or lead to us designing a further test called "persevere" if we are unable to validate assumptions.

As shown in the above diagram, we do not always have to build something to understand if we should or shouldn't go ahead with a piece of work. Data is a very powerful tool and if you are an established business like Simply Business who have data at its heart, we are able to prove or disprove some hypothesis using data, without the need to build.

You may have already experienced BML without knowing it. Ever visited a website that says something along the lines of "Thanks for visiting us, we're still working on the final touches, to keep up to date with us, please subscribe to our mailing lists"?

That's a form of BML at work, the company will be tracking how many people sign up to their newsletter/updates to see what appetite there is for their product.

A more common example and one closer to home is adding a new trade within Simply Business quote set. When we want to test a new product on offer, we will create a journey the customer can go through, specific questions etc and then show them a "no quote" page when they get to the comparison page.

Here we are trying to understand the market for this type of insurance and the type of risks we may place. We can then use this data to design a product with our insurers.

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

There is much debate in the agile community to what the acronym actually stands for in this practice.

For example Minimum **Valuable** Product, Minimum **Loveable** Product, Minimum **Marketable** Feature, Minimum **Viable** Investment, **Earliest**, **Testable**, **Useable** and so on, you get the picture. In short, they all follow the same practice with subtle differences, this is an example where the agile community has forgot the principle of **Simplicity** and over complicated a rather simple practice.

Eric Ries simply defines MVP as “The Minimal Viable Product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.”

A great visualisation of MVP can be seen [here](http://www.adduco.digital/archive/minimum-viable-product-mvp/)

We **can** use MVP's alongside BML or on it's on as part of the Lean methodology. We can use it alongside BML to validate our learnings sooner whilst potentially delivering value.

If you want to learn more about BML and MVP, please come and speak to your Agile Coaches, as these topics are rather large and can be easier to understand by the art of gameification and explanation.


## Estimation

There are loads of techniques that exist for estimation, from Planning Poker, Cynefin, Fibonacci sequence, Dog Pointing to T-shirt sizes, plus many more.

It's hard to say that one technique is better than the other, as it depends on the environment and maturity of the teams you work in.

At Simply Business we use a combination of [Cynefin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7oz366X0-8) and the [Fibonacci sequence](http://www.livescience.com/37470-fibonacci-sequence.html).

### What's the definition of an estimate?

Google will tell you it's Approximation, prediction or projection of quantity based on experience or information available at the time.

As humans we find it naturally hard to accurately predict the future, unless you are a clarevoyant and even then the jury is out! This is why estimates should not be considered as confirmation or a concrete measurement such as day, time or place.

Try it now for yourself, what are you going to have for dinner tonight? what are you going to have for dinner tomorrow? what are you going to have for dinner next Tuesday? what are you going to have for dinner on the 11th of next month? What are you going to have for dinner in 6 months time? What are you going to have for dinner in 1 years time?

I'm sure you get the picture by now, the longer the length of time, the more difficult it is to predict or estimate what the outcome will be. Even in the example of choosing dinner above it's difficult and that's a simple example, take into account complexity, risk, effort, requirement changes, people changes, cost changes to name a few and those concrete estimates like "it will take 5 days" start to sound crazy.

Another way I like to explain estimates by telling this [story](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19dkquigJ1IW969CfliCJqI_ky-2B-Whu9_Tgr_CV7bU/edit)

### Why do we estimate?

Depending on what framework we chose to work in, will depend on whether you decide to use estimates or not, for example estimation is optional under Kanban, due to some specific framework difference with say scrum for example.

So why would we estimate in other frameworks?

- Tracking velocity
- Deciding on the scope for an iteration (sprint planning)
- Prioritizing stories (what will give us the most bang for the buck)
- Release planning
- Discuss complexity

There are also a number of hidden benefits to estimation.

In order for a team to estimate well a team will need to discuss in detail what's involved in a story. This can often lead to conversations about previously unrevealed unrecognized dependencies, ambiguous or contradictory requirements, and so on.

At Simply Business, you may have seen teams in the process of estimating, usually by people shouting out numbers or holding up a number of fingers. They are using Cynefin and Fibonacci to estimate based on risk, complexity and effort.

Team members will only vote when they have enough information and may abstain completely. If the teams can't agree on a estimate, they will discuss the differences, often sharing information previously not known. For example someone may know an easier way or someone may have considered something we haven't thought of.
